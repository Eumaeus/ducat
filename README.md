\* [Ugarit iAligner](http://ugarit.ialigner.com) is a brilliant user interface for translation alignment, created by Maryam Foradi, Chiara Palladino, and Tariq Yousef. This application, DUCAT, was inspired by the philological model behind [Ugarit](http://ugarit.ialigner.com) and the potential for scholarship and pedagogy it represents. Hence, "Daughter of Ugarit". A [*ducat*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducat) was once the gold “coin of the realm” allowing commerce among nations.
